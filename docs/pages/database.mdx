# Queries

One of the most important part of a website is the database. VitNode use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to interact with the database. Prisma is a modern database toolkit. It replaces traditional ORMs and makes database access easy with an auto-generated query builder for TypeScript & NodeJS.

## Example

```ts
const edges = await this.prisma.core_members.findMany();
```

If you want more information about the query, you can read the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries).

## Helpers

VitNode provide a few helpers functions to help you build your query. We recommend using this helpers functions to build your query.
