# GraphQL

VitNode use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to query and mutate data and [Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) to generate typescript types. It's a powerful tool that allows you to query only the data you need and get the data in the shape you want.

Before we start, we're recomending you to read the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/) to understand the basics of the language and [NestJS GraphQL documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start) to understand how we're using it in VitNode.

In this tutorial we're create a simple query and mutation with the categories data and [Internationalization (i18n)](/plugins/i18n) from the blog plugin.

## Module

<Steps>

### Create

To save consistency and make it easier to maintain, we're going to create a module to store all the queries and mutations involvin the categories of the blog. Each feature should have its own module.

For example if you have `blogs_categories` and `blogs_articles` in the database, you should have two modules, one for each feature.

Let's create a new file in the `backend/plugins/blog/categories/categories.module.ts` file and add the following code:

```ts
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";

@Module({
  providers: []
})
export class BlogCategoriesModule {}
```

Name class whatever you want, but it's a good practice to name it after the feature you're working on.

### Import to the main module

Now we need to import the module we just created to the main module of the blog plugin. Open the `backend/plugins/blog/blog.module.ts` file and add the following code:

```ts {4, 7}
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";

import { AdminBlogModule } from "./admin/admin.module";
import { BlogCategoriesModule } from "./categories/categories.module";

@Module({
  imports: [AdminBlogModule, BlogCategoriesModule]
})
export class BlogModule {}
```

</Steps>

## Query

As an example, we're going to create a query to get all the categories from the blog plugin.
