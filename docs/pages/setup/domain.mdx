# Domain

Your first step to install VitNode is to choose a domain name for your website.

## Register a domain

_(If you have already a domain, you can skip this step)_

You can register a domain name with any domain registrar. For example we use [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).

## Configure DNS

We recommend using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, but if you don't want to use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can use any other DNS provider or connect DNS directly to your server.

<Steps>

### Create an Cloudflare account

Create an account on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) or log in if you already have an account.

### Add a site

Add your domain to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). You can do this by clicking on the "Add a site" button and following the instructions.

### Add records

Add `A` record for your domain and point it to your server's IP address.

## SSL Certificate

You need to install an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS on your domain.

If you are using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can use Cloudflare's SSL certificate and following the instructions below.

<Steps>

Open the panel for your domain on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

### Proxy status

Save these certificates, you will need to use the certificate and private key when you configure your server.

### Force HTTPS

Go to the "Rules => `Configuration Rules`" tab and add click on the `Add a rule` button. Fill in the form with the following settings:

- `Name` - vitnode
- `When incoming requests match` - Set to `All incoming requests`,
