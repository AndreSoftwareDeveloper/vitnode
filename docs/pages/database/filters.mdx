Vitnode provide a filters system to help you to easily building query with filters. The filters system is based on the [Prisma filtering and sorting system](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/filtering-and-sorting).

Here is an example of how to use the sorting system. We will use the `core_members` table as an example.
