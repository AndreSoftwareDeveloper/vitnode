# Authorization

In VitNode we're implementing a custom authorization system, which gives us more flexibility and control over the authorization process. Our system use [Guards](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards) from NestJS to protect routes.

## Sign In required

To protect a route, you need to add the `@UseGuards(AuthStrategy)` decorator to the route handler. This will make sure that the user is authenticated before accessing the route.

Here is an example for resolver:

```typescript
  @Query(() => ShowCoreMembersObj)
  @UseGuards(AuthGuards)
  async show_core_members(@Args() args: ShowCoreMembersArgs): Promise<ShowCoreMembersObj> {
    return await this.service.show(args);
  }
```
