## Do not modify config.json

The `config.json` file is generated by the VitNode. This values are used by databse and the VitNode itself. If you modify this file, the VitNode will not work properly.

## Name queries and mutations

When you create a new query or mutation, you should name it in `resolver` file. For the best readability, you should name it with:

```
appliaction_module__action
```

1. `application` - name of the application,
2. `module` - name of the module,
3. `action` - name of the action

Example:

```
core_members__show
```

If your want more deeper structure, you can use:

```
application_module__submodule__action
```
