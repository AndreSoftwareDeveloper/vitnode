## Example use

Test

## Plugins

- **History** - Undo/redo changes _(For example go back by pressing `Ctrl+Z` or `Cmd+Z` on Mac)_
- **RichText** - Entering text, deleting characters, copy + paste etc.
- **Markdown** - Write markdown
- **AutoLinkPluginEditor** - Automatically convert URLs to links

## Good to know

- Convert `http` URLs to links is not working for users safety. Users need to use `https` instead,
- `HTML` tags are not allowed. Users can use `Markdown` instead,
- `Font Family` is not implemented. Users don't like to change it when they are writing,
- `Code Block` has prettier support. Users can format code by pressing a button in the toolbar,
